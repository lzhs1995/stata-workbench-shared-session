# Stata Workbench Shared Session

> This development branch contains `visible-cowork-1-dev.6`, **not a new
> live-accepted release**. Read [candidate scope and remaining acceptance](docs/VISIBLE_COWORK_UPGRADE.md).
> Do not install over an active research backend. The released version below
> remains a separate, unchanged runtime; its FULL45 evidence does not cover this branch.

A VS Code extension for a visible Stata session shared sequentially by a human
and AI agents. Human Run File/Selection and agent commands use the same backend,
with visible output, graphs, execution serialization and recovery diagnostics.

中文：让人与 AI 在 VS Code 中轮流操作同一个 Stata 会话，共享数据和结果。
不是两个隐藏进程，也不是并发执行。

## Current Release

[Download v0.1.3-rc.7.39-public.2](https://github.com/lzhs1995/stata-workbench-shared-session/releases/tag/v0.1.3-rc.7.39-public.2)

Public packaging revision of extension version `0.1.3-rc.7.39`. Runtime bundle
unchanged from the locally accepted Mac installation. This VSIX removes a local
maintenance token and updates documentation; it is **not byte-identical** to the
private acceptance VSIX. It is published as a prerelease, not cross-platform stable.

Revision 2 updates Mac tools and permission documentation: errors such as `-1743`
are no longer reported as zero windows. Use `--doctor` and explicit
`--request-permissions` in the actual agent host. This is a diagnostic/guard fix,
**not a claim that every host is authorized**; the observed local permission-service
failure still needs system recovery. [Permission guide](docs/MAC_PERMISSIONS.md).

The fixed runtime passed a local FULL45 run: 45 scenarios, 632 steps (575
assertions, 57 observations), independent replay and human-to-agent-to-human
same-backend proof. S29 had one bounded product zero-ACK retry. S41's native
self-log was incomplete. See [acceptance scope](docs/ACCEPTANCE.md).

## Install And Use

Requirements: licensed Stata, VS Code, Python/uv runtime dependencies. Stata,
licenses, credentials and private data are not included. Current validation is
Mac-specific; Windows/Linux do not inherit certification from older releases.

1. Download the VSIX and verify SHA256SUMS from the release.
2. Use VS Code **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**.
3. Configure `stataMcp.stataPath` and open **Stata: Open Interactive Terminal**.
4. Open a `.do` file; run **Stata: Run Current File** or **Stata: Run Selection/Current Line**.

[中文使用指南](docs/USAGE.zh-CN.md) | [English quick start](docs/QUICKSTART.md)

For the Mac launcher and AI client, clone this repository at the release tag and
configure the isolated profile described in the guide:

```sh
python3 tools/verified_workbench.py --status
python3 tools/shared_stata.py --code 'display 1+1' --cwd /absolute/workspace
```

The client refuses a wrong bundle/listener owner, duplicate launcher, busy or
recovering session, or changed backend. It never resets Stata or retries an
unconfirmed POST. Keep the bridge on loopback: it is not a remote multi-user service.

## Development

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run check
python3 -B -m unittest discover -s tools -p 'test_*.py'
npm run package
```

`check` is read-only with a runtime digest guard. Packaging uses the versioned
maintained bundle, readable patches/helpers and UI sources, not a claimed clean
reconstruction of upstream TypeScript. See [release maintenance](docs/RELEASE.md).
New runtime edits require a new version and fresh live acceptance. CI is offline:
no licensed Stata, GUI keys, extension installation, or live acceptance claims.
